The final product: http://heyplayagee.github.io/bobahol1cDB/

Find tasty boba from Steven Cong's bobahol1c.tumblr.com in an easy-to-read database! 

When I saw the <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2015/09/19/ucla-graduate-student-tastes-tea-to-build-boba-database/">UCLA Bruins article</a> shared on Facebook about a boba database, I had to view it. Steven Cong posts his experiences at many boba places around California.

Cong's posts can be found at <a href="http://bobahol1c.tumblr.com">bobahol1c.tumblr.com</a>. Check it out for great reviews. I don't agree with all of them, but he wins for documenting all of his adventures.
